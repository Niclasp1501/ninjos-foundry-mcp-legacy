## Unreleased

### Security: only your own Foundry can use the bridge now

Until now the MCP server asked nobody who was connecting. The bridge on port 31415
upgraded any WebSocket, the signaling server on 31416 answered every page with
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, and both listened on every network interface. Any
web page open in the same browser, and any machine on the same network, could call
every tool: scene, actor and journal writes included. WebSockets have no same-origin
policy, so the browser did nothing to stop it.

- **Both ports listen on loopback only** (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`). If your browser
  runs on a different machine than the MCP server, set `FOUNDRY_REMOTE_MODE=true`.
- **Every connection is checked against the page's origin.** Set
  `FOUNDRY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma separated list, for example
  `http://localhost:30000,https://*.forge-vtt.com`. Without it, the server remembers
  the first Foundry that connects and refuses every other address afterwards. The
  remembered address is kept in `allowed-origins.json` (next to the installer on
  Windows, under `~/.config/ninjos-foundry-mcp` elsewhere); delete that file to have
  it learn again.
- **A refused page is told why.** The status readout above the player list shows
  "MCP: address not allowed" together with the address and both ways out, instead
  of looking like a server that is not running.
- **The control channel on 31414 drops HTTP requests.** A browser could POST to it,
  and the body line would have run as a tool call.

### The module no longer gives up reconnecting

The backend exits a minute after the last MCP client disconnects, by design. The
module used to stop after five attempts, so closing Claude Desktop and opening it
later left the bridge down until someone clicked. It now keeps trying every 30
seconds, and the readout turns red after the quick first attempts rather than
blinking gold for hours. A clean close from the server also counts as a reason to
reconnect now; only a disconnect the module asked for does not.

### Security: players can no longer run MCP actions through the gamemaster

Foundry lets every user with the "Query users" permission, which players have by
default, send a registered query to the gamemaster's client. Every action of this
module was registered that way, and each one only checked whether the client it ran
on belonged to a gamemaster, which on that client is always true. A player could
therefore delete actors, rewrite paths across the whole world or change any journal
from the browser console, with gamemaster rights. The module now refuses every call
that arrives through Foundry's user queries. The MCP bridge itself is not affected.

### The write switch and the permissions now apply to every change

"Allow Write Operations" promised that the AI changes nothing while it is off, but
scenes, compendiums, playlists and roll tables ignored it, and most actor, item,
token and ownership tools checked neither the switch nor the permissions per
document type. Every tool that writes now checks both.

- **Deleting actors or items on actors now needs "Permissions: actors" set to
  "Create, change and delete"**, like every other delete. That is off by default.
- Switching the active scene and moving, changing or removing tokens count as
  changing scenes.
- A path rewrite with `dryRun` still only needs writing to be switched on; the real
  rewrite also needs change rights for scenes, actors, journals, playlists and roll
  tables.
- Splitting a journal page with `deleteOriginal` needs delete rights for journals.

### Long quest journal pages no longer lose their end

`update-quest-journal` and `link-quest-to-npc` read a journal page, changed it and
wrote it back. Page content arrives in chunks of 50,000 characters, and only the
first chunk was read, so everything past it was deleted when the page was written.
Both tools now read the whole page before writing and write nothing if any part is
missing. Adding to a specific page (`pageId`) now appends inside Foundry instead of
sending the page back and forth. `link-quest-to-npc` also says so when it finds no
place for the link, instead of reporting success.

### Smaller fixes

- A previous backend still holding a port while the next one starts no longer fails
  the start: the listener retries for a few seconds.
- `FOUNDRY_MCP_CONTROL_HOST` makes the control channel address configurable, as the
  port already was.
- 19 of 42 npm advisories are gone. Nothing that ships changed major version. The
  one chain left at runtime is `werift`, the WebRTC library, which needs a major
  upgrade and gets its own change.
- The release workflows take the repository from their context instead of a
  hardcoded address, so a fork no longer submits this repository's manifest.
- `package-lock.json` is back in step with the version, and the version check now
  reads it too.
- A `.claude/settings.local.json` inherited from upstream is no longer tracked. It
  granted agent sessions in this repository commands such as `Bash(sudo:*)`.

The findings behind this section came from 9atatimer, who ran into them while
getting the server to work in a fork.

## v14.2609.3 (2026-09-07)

### The bridge could be dead without anything saying so

On 2026-09-06 the bridge was down for eleven hours before anyone noticed. The
backend starts a signaling server for the WebRTC detour on port 31416, and a
failure there rejected — so `start()` gave up before it ever reached the listen
call for the actual bridge port. The backend still came up, registered every
system adapter, offered all 79 tools, and answered each one with "module not
connected".

WebRTC is only the detour for a browser that refuses `ws://` — Foundry served
over HTTPS from a non-loopback host. Losing the detour costs that one case;
losing the bridge costs every case. A failure there is now a warning and startup
carries on, and every start logs whether the detour is available.

### The GM can see the bridge state at a glance

A small readout above the player list: green when connected, gold while
connecting, red when not, grey when switched off in the settings. Clicking a dead
bridge reconnects it and reports what happened; hovering shows the host and port.

It is deliberately quiet while things work — an indicator that alarms when
everything is fine gets ignored, and is then worth nothing on the day it is
right. "Switched off" is grey rather than red for the same reason. GM only, since
players can neither act on it nor change the settings.

### The source is in English now

Comments, identifiers and error messages throughout both packages. The repository
is public, and everything needed to follow a bug or send a patch was in German.
Comments were translated, not shortened — they carry the reasoning, which is the
part nobody can reconstruct from a diff.

Two field names crossed the server/module boundary and moved together, and the
setting `werkzeugModule` became `toolProviderModules`. A world that filled the
old key keeps its list: it is carried over once at the next world start, and the
old query names `listFremdwerkzeuge` and `callFremdwerkzeug` stay registered as
aliases, so a module still on 14.2609.2 keeps answering.

The upstream system adapters under `src/systems/` (dsa5, mgt2e, wfrp4e) were left
as they came in — rewriting them would make every future comparison against the
origin harder, and their German is the vocabulary of a German game system.

## v14.2609.2 (2026-09-06)

Three defects in what the Windows installer hands out, found by staging its
payload and running it the way Claude Desktop would.

- **The handshake reported the version as "unbekannt".** `paketVersion()` resolved
  its own location through `import.meta.url`, which esbuild defines as the literal
  string `"bundled"` in the packaged build. It now uses `__dirname` when present.
- **The module logo was missing.** `assets/` was never copied into the Foundry
  module, so the welcome window on first start showed a broken image placeholder.
- **The licence was missing.** The MIT licence of the upstream project requires the
  copyright notice to travel with every copy; a module installed this way carried
  none. Copying it is now mandatory — a missing `LICENSE` aborts the build.

The release zip was unaffected by all three; only the installer path was.

## v14.2609.1 (2026-09-06)

### The compendium allowlist actually saves now

Ticking individual compendiums under _Release compendiums_ and pressing save
stored nothing. The checkboxes are named `pack.<id>` and a pack id contains a dot
itself, so Foundry expanded the field names into nested objects before the save
handler saw them; the handler looked for top-level keys starting with `pack.` and
never matched. An empty list means "every unlocked compendium is writable", so
restricting access through the dialog silently did the opposite of what it said.

Leaving "release every unlocked compendium" ticked at the top discarded the
selection too — that check ran first and returned before reading the ticks. The
two now exclude each other in the form, and a selection wins over "allow all".

The dialog also groups by module instead of putting every module's compendiums in
one pot, and its text now describes what the module actually does: a tick means
work on this one is allowed, and a lock is lifted for the single operation and
restored afterwards.

### Map generation is off unless you switch it on

`COMFYUI_ENABLED=true` now gates the whole thing. Without it nothing is created —
no job queue, no client, no auto-start — and the three tools that need ComfyUI are
not offered at all. Before, the client was built regardless and retried a failing
connection every five seconds forever; one log had grown to 19 MB of nothing else.

### The bridge no longer drops out with two sessions open

The MCP server is a wrapper per session plus one shared backend. Only the wrapper
that spawned the backend held a reference to it, and killed it on its own exit —
even with another wrapper still connected. Closing one session tore down the
shared backend and the other lost its connection, which the Foundry module only
recovers from on the next world load. The backend now counts its wrappers and
shuts down a grace period after the last one leaves.

### Also

- **A welcome window on first start**, GM only, respecting "do not show again".
- **`list-compendium-entries`** shows what is actually inside a pack — ids, names,
  types, folders — reading the index only and paging through large packs.
- **`delete-compendium-entries`** removes named entries, by id or exact name, with
  a dry run. There is deliberately no "empty this pack"; if a selection happens to
  cover every entry, the exact label is required as well.
- **Exporting a scene with tokens into a compendium works again.** Overwriting an
  existing entry failed inside Foundry on the token ActorDelta, so every such scene
  was silently skipped and an archive could never be updated.
- **The handshake reports the real name and version** instead of
  `foundry-mcp-server 1.0.0`.

## v14.2608.1 (2026-08-30)

Preparing this fork for submission to the Foundry package registry.

### Versioning changed to `<foundry-major>.<YYMM>.<patch>`

This project used semantic versioning inherited from upstream, while every other
module in this workshop uses the Foundry-targeted scheme: `14` is the Foundry major
version, `2608` the year and month, and the patch restarts at `1` each month. Tags
carry a `v` prefix. `scripts/version-pruefen.mjs` enforces it and refuses a release
whose tag does not match the manifest — the drift it guards against has already
happened elsewhere, where an August release went out numbered as November.

### Both halves now ship from one tag

The module and the MCP server talk over roughly a hundred query names that exist
only as strings; nothing checks them. On 2026-08-30 a rebuild of the server alone
broke that contract silently, and it took a while to notice. Two consequences:

- **`scripts/abfragen-pruefen.mjs`** compares the queries the server calls against
  those the module registers and fails the release if one is missing. It found
  `getPackIndex` immediately — see below.
- A tag `v*` now builds **both** artefacts from the same commit: `module.json` and
  `module.zip` for Foundry, and the PC installers. The module release additionally
  submits to the Foundry catalogue when `PACKAGE_TOKEN` is present, and says so in
  the log when it is not.

### Fixed: `list-dsa5-archetypes` silently returned nothing

The server called `getPackIndex`, which the module never registered. The call sat
inside a `try/catch` that only logged a warning, so the tool answered with an empty
list instead of an error. The query now exists, and it takes an explicit `fields`
list — Foundry only puts requested fields into an index, so the DSA5 filters were
reading properties that were never loaded.

### Breaking: the module id is now `ninjos-foundry-mcp`

The old id `foundry-mcp-bridge` belongs to the upstream project and is already
taken in the Foundry package registry, so this fork could never have been
submitted under it. Foundry treats the rename as a **new module**: after updating,
enable "Ninjo's Foundry MCP" in Module Management once, and rename the module
directory on the server to match the new id.

- **Settings are carried over automatically** on the first world start
  (`uebernehmeAlteEinstellungen()` in `settings.ts`). Server address, the
  permission matrix and the list of writable compendiums survive the rename. The
  step never overwrites a value already set under the new id, so it is safe to run
  on every start.
- **The MCP server has to be restarted.** The query prefix between server and
  module changed with the id; an old server and a new module do not talk to each
  other.
- Lost in the rename, both expendable: the audit log, and the roll buttons under
  chat messages that already exist. Scenes, journals, actors and campaign status
  do not hang on the module id.

### Attribution

This is a fork of [adambdooley/foundry-vtt-mcp](https://github.com/adambdooley/foundry-vtt-mcp)
by Adam Dooley, used under the MIT license. The manifest, the installers and the
release workflow still carried his name, his e-mail address and — more seriously —
his manifest and download URLs, which would have updated users of this fork onto
the original project.

- Manifest, download, issue and changelog URLs now point at this repository
- `authors` names the maintainer of this fork. The upstream author is credited in
  the LICENSE and in the README instead, which is what the MIT license asks for.
- **The module ZIP now ships a LICENSE.** It is built from
  `packages/foundry-module/`, so the file at the repository root never reached the
  distributed module — the MIT notice was missing from every copy handed out.
- The title is "Ninjo's Foundry MCP", clearly apart from the registered
  "Foundry MCP Bridge"
- Versions across the workspace were inconsistent (0.9.0 / 0.8.2 against a
  CHANGELOG at 0.10.0) and are now aligned

---

## v0.10.0 (2026-08-28)

Scene management. Until now the bridge could list, switch and AI-generate scenes,
but not build one from artwork that already exists on disk — the everyday case
when you produce your own location art.

### New Features

- **`create-scene`** — build a scene from an image or video in the Foundry data directory
  - Dimensions are measured from the file itself, videos included
  - `templateName` copies an existing scene's settings (grid, lighting, module flags) but **never its id**
  - `folderPath` accepts nested paths like `Orte/Neverwinter`; missing levels are created

- **`update-scene`** — rename, swap the background, move to another folder, change dimensions or navigation. A new background re-measures the dimensions.

- **`list-scene-folders`** — every scene folder with its full path, scene count and id

- **`delete-scene`** — deletes by id on purpose, so a similarly named scene cannot be hit by accident. Refuses to delete the active scene.

### Why create-scene exists

Dragging a scene out of a compendium keeps its id and **overwrites any world scene
carrying the same id**, silently. That is how a finished landing page scene was lost
on 2026-08-27. `create-scene` copies settings but always assigns a fresh id, so it
cannot destroy anything.

### Fixes discovered while building this

- **Media paths must be URL-encoded.** Foundry stores `Gefängnis` as `Gef%C3%A4ngnis`. A path with raw umlauts is discarded without any error and the scene ends up blank.
- **Foundry v14 keeps the background on the scene's level, not on the scene.** Setting only `scene.background.src` leaves the scene empty; the default level (`defaultLevel0000`) has to be updated too.

See `docs/NINJO-ERWEITERUNGEN.md` for details.

## v0.9.0 (2026-07-22)

Journal handling for large imported adventures, clean journal editing, and token art.
See the README section "Working with large imported adventures" for the reasoning.

### New Features

- **Clean journal tools** — content stored verbatim, no quest template, no auto-appended junk page
  - `journal-create`, `journal-set-page`, `journal-add-page`
  - `journal-delete-page`, `journal-delete`, `journal-rename`
  - `folder-rename`, `folder-delete`

- **Large-content handling** — Foundry's socket silently drops the connection when a response gets too big; a single 250k-character page killed the bridge reliably
  - Reading: `list-journals` chunks content (`offset` / `maxChars`, default 50k, max 200k) and returns `contentLength` / `hasMore` / `nextOffset`, so partial reads are visible instead of looking complete
  - Writing: `journal-page-from-file` — the browser fetches a file straight from Foundry's Data directory, so **nothing crosses the socket** and size stops mattering
  - `journal-append-page` — alternative write path: create with the first chunk, append the rest

- **`journal-split-page`** — split an oversized page into one page per section
  - Sections detected via `DOMParser` at a chosen heading level; original markup carried over untouched
  - Rarely needed: Foundry already builds a nested table of contents from headings inside a page, and splitting _loses_ that hierarchy because pages cannot nest

- **`journal-rewrite-images`** — external image URLs (CDN) → local Foundry paths; supports `dryRun`

- **`journal-link-tags`** — raw `@creature[…]` / `@item[…]` tags from an import → real `@UUID` links
  - Matches by name **and** by derived document ID (`"mm" + PascalCase(name)`, padded to 16 chars). Localised packs translate names but keep the English 2024 IDs, so `guard` resolves to `Wache` via `mmGuard000000000`. Raised one real chapter from 18 to 96 resolved links
  - Unresolved names are **reported**, never silently skipped
  - Supports `dryRun`

- **`actor-set-token`** — token image, portrait, prototype token name, dynamic ring
  - Enabling the ring sets `ring.enabled` **and** `ring.subject.texture`; with only the flag Foundry draws the ring around an empty field
  - Ring colour follows disposition automatically (hostile red, neutral blue, friendly green), overridable via `ringColor`
  - `tokenName` — without it, placed tokens keep the compendium name instead of the actor's

### Fixes

- `actor-set-token` reset `ring.subject.scale` to `1` on every call with `ring: true`, silently destroying a hand-tuned scale. The field is now only touched when a value is passed
- `journal-split-page` placed new pages at the end of the journal instead of after the source page (Foundry spaces `sort` values 100000 apart, so the naive `+1` sorted last)
- `journal-split-page` found only a single section on imported chapters, which wrap all sections in one container `div`; the parser now descends into it and also recognises an element that _is_ the heading

## v0.8.3 (2026-06-11)

### New Features

- **Mongoose Traveller 2e (mgt2e) System Support**
  - `list-creatures-by-criteria` now works on mgt2e worlds: filters by hit points, psionics, creature type, and actor type; indexed metadata includes characteristic DMs (STR/DEX/etc.)
  - `search-compendium` extracts mgt2e-relevant stats (hits, behaviour, species, tonnage) from search results
  - `manage-world-items` gains a new `describe` action that returns a live enum reference for mgt2e item fields (weapon traits, scales, armour forms, hardware system discriminators, software classes, etc.) — call it before creating items to get valid keys

- **`manage-actors` — generic actor CRUD tool** (works on any game system)
  - `create`: create one or more actors of any type with arbitrary `system` data; mgt2e convenience: accepts skill shorthands (`{ pilot: 2 }`), lowercase characteristic keys, and `system.details` remapped to `system.sophont`
  - `update`: patch existing actors by ID; mgt2e skill shorthands normalised server-side (avoids Electron module-cache issue that prevented browser-side normalisation)
  - `delete`: delete actors by ID
  - `update-items`: update embedded items on an actor by item ID
  - `delete-items`: delete embedded items from an actor by item ID

### Fixes

- `getIndex()` now uses the return value rather than `pack.indexed` state, fixing compendium indexing on Foundry v13 where `pack.indexed` behaviour changed

## v0.4.17 (2025-09-09)

- Wrapper/backend architecture: convert MCP entry to a thin stdio wrapper that proxies to a singleton backend over `127.0.0.1:31414`.
- Backend singleton + lock: backend binds Foundry connector on `31415` and creates `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-backend.lock`.
- Startup race fix: resolves Claude Desktop duplicate-start race by keeping wrappers alive and ensuring only one backend owns ports.
- Runtime stability: backend now bundled (`dist/backend.bundle.cjs`) and preferred by wrapper for reliable startup in installer environments.
- Shared package now emits JS + d.ts, ensuring runtime availability for both dev and installer.
- Logging: wrapper writes to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\wrapper.log`; backend logs to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\mcp-server.log`.
- Installer: enhanced staging to include full server `dist`, bundled wrapper `index.cjs`, bundled backend, and `node_modules/@foundry-mcp/shared`.
- Build scripts: added root convenience scripts (`build:release`, `bundle:server`, `installer:stage`); NSIS script accepts `--skip-download` and `--skip-nsis` for staging-only runs.

Notes

- No changes needed for CI; existing workflows continue to build bundles and the installer.
- Foundry MCP Bridge port remains `31415`. Control channel is `31414` (internal wrapper↔backend only).
