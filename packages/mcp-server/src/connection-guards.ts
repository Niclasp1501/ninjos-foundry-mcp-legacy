/**
 * Who may talk to this server.
 *
 * Until 14.2609.3 nobody was asked. The bridge on 31415 upgraded any WebSocket
 * whose path matched, the signaling server on 31416 answered every origin with
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, and both listened on every interface. So
 * any web page open in the GM's browser, and any machine on the same network,
 * could drive every tool the module exposes: scene, actor and journal writes
 * included. WebSockets have no same-origin policy; nothing in the browser stops
 * a page from connecting to localhost.
 *
 * The Origin header is the right discriminator: a browser always sends it on a
 * WebSocket handshake and on a cross-origin POST, and a page cannot forge it.
 *
 * What the right origin is cannot be hardcoded. It is `http://localhost:30000`
 * for a local Foundry, the GM's own domain for a hosted one, a
 * `*.forge-vtt.com` address on The Forge. Hence two modes:
 *
 * 1. **A configured list** (`FOUNDRY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) is the whole truth.
 *    Nothing is learned while it is set.
 * 2. **Without a list, the first origin is remembered** and kept in a file.
 *    Every later connection must come from that same origin. The module
 *    connects on its own as soon as the world loads, so in practice the first
 *    origin is the GM's Foundry. That is weaker than a list, and deliberately
 *    so: an update must not lock out everyone who has never heard of the
 *    variable.
 *
 * Found by 9atatimer while getting the server to run in their fork, 2026-09-12.
